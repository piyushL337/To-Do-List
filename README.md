# To-Do-List

<p>To Do List project is a single webpage containing different list items and a text area to add custom tasks. The “Add” button lets the user add an object to the list. We have the facility to check the items from the list or remove them if we want.</p>

<p>It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks any time and delete a task which is completed.
  </p>
  <p><b>The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:</b></p>

- Add tasks
- Update tasks
- Read tasks
- Delete tasks
